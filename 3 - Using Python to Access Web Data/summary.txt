Regular Expressions (Chapter 11)

    Regular expressions are a very specialized language that allow us to succinctly search strings and extract data from strings. Regular expressions are a language unto themselves. It is not essential to know how to use regular expressions, but they can be quite useful and powerful.

    11.1 - Regular Expressions
    11.2 - Extracting Data
    Assignment: Extracting Data With Regular Expressions

Networks and Sockets (Chapter 12)

    In this section we learn about the protocols that web browsers use to retrieve documents and web applications use to interact with Application Program Interfaces (APIs).

    12.1 - Networked Technology
    12.2 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    Using the Develpor Console to Explore HTTP
    Assignment: Understanding the Request / Response Cycle

Programs that Surf the Web (Chapter 12)
    In this section we learn to use Python to retrieve data from web sites and APIs over the Internet.

    12.3 - Unicode Characters and Strings (strings unicode -> bytes UTF-8 -> socket)
    12.4 - Retrieving Web Pages (urllib library)
    12.5 - Parsing Web Pages (BeautifulSoup library)
    Using urllib and BeautifulSoup to retrieve Web Pages content
    Assignment: Scraping Numbers from HTML using BeautifulSoup

Web Services and XML (Chapter 13)
    In this section, we learn how to retrieve and parse XML (eXtensible Markup Language) data.

JSON and the REST Architecture (Chapter 13)
    In this module, we work with Application Program Interfaces / Web Services using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format.

    13.5 - JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (object -> dictionary in Python, array -> list in Python)
    13.6 - Service Oriented Approach (Applications that use services from other applications / Services publish "rules" for applications to follow (API))
    13.7 - Using Application Programming Interfaces (Using Google geocode API)
    13.8 - Securing API Requests (Twitter API example)
    Assignment: Extracting Data from JSON
    Assignment: Using the GeoJSON API
