Module 1 - Object Oriented Python
    To start this class out we cover the basics of Object Oriented Python. We won't be writing our own objects, but since many of the things we use like BeautifulSoup, strings, dictionaries, database connections all use Object Oriented (OO) patterns we should at least understand some of its patterns and terminology.

    14.1 - Object Oriented Definitions and Terminology (Class, Methods, Attributes, Object/Instance)
    14.2 - Our First Class and Object (Moment of construction / Creating a class)
    14.3 - Object Life Cycle (Constructor and Destructor / __init__ and __del__)
    14.4 - Object Inheritance (Extending a Class / Subclasses)

Module 2 - Basic Structured Query Language
    We learn the four core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) to manage data stored in a database.

    15.1 - Relational Databases (Table(relation), Row(tuple), Column(attibute))
    15.2 - Using Databases
    15.3 - Single Table CRUD (CREATE TABLE table, SELECT * FROM table, INSERT INTO table VALUES, UPDATE table SET, DELETE FROM table, DROP TABLE table) 
    Assignment: Our First Database


Module 3 - Data Models and Relational SQL
    In this section we learn about how data is stored across multiple tables in a database and how rows are linked (i.e., we establish relationships) in the database.

    15.4 - Designing a Data Model (modelo de dados relacional / Diagrama ER)
    15.5 - Representing a Data Model in Tables (Diagrama -> tabelas)
    15.6 - Inserting Relational Data
    15.7 - Reconstructing Data with JOIN (SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.idTable2 = table2.id)
    Assignment: Multi-Table Database - Tracks

Module 4 - Many-to-Many Relationships in SQL
    In this section we explore how to model situations like students enrolling in courses where each course has many students and each student is enrolled in many courses.

    15.8 - Many-to-Many Relationships
    Assignment: Many Students in Many Courses

Module 5 - Databases and Visualization
    In this section, we put it all together, retrieve and process some data and then use the Google Maps API to visualize our data.

    16.1 - Geocoding (Multi-Step Data Analysis)
    16.2 - Geocoding Visualization
